	<p> A major issue with tall / long drinks is their predilection to separate flavors. This issue is compounded by the weight of the ingredients utilized in this drink. To avoid this we will roll the drink instead of building it in the glass so as to blend every flavor together. Add all ingredients to a tin filled halfway with cube ice. Roll into a Collins glass twice. Garnish with Lemon Peel and a straw. Top with additional Guinness for a frothy head.

	<p> This drink is a classic vodka soda highball fancied up with some infusions and a pretty garnish. The ingredients are very thin, so they can be built in the glass with no issue. For consistency sake, add the ice to the Collins glass - pour the mixture into the glass, top with soda, stir, top with additional soda and then the green bitters.

	<p> A Clarified Milk Punch with an even more esoteric culinary technique applied with dairy infusion. We take Mexican Crema and infuse that with the grain portion of Lucky Charms. We strain out this mixture and combine it with Bushmill’s Irish Whisky, Cocchi Americano, Lemon Juice, Earl Grey Tea and Simple Syrup. This sits overnight, when the curds seperate from the whey we strain this through a microbag and bottle it.

	</table>
	<p> Fat washed Manhattan variation with an interesting choice of garnish. We take the small marrow-rich bones from spare ribs, char them to a crisp in the broiler and force infuse them with vida mezcal utilizing an isi whipper. The Rib Mezcal is then left in a freezer overnight where the fats will separate and solidify at the top of the mixture. Strain this off and combine with Cocchi Torino and a pinch of salt.

	</table>
	<p> Whipping drinks is short speak for a lazy pebble ice shake. The purpose being to mix the ingredients without chilling them drastically. Combine the Tahini Coconut Cream with Pineapple juice and about 4-5 pebbles of ice. Short shake and dirty dump into a collins glass. Fill the glass with pebble ice and swizzle. Garnish with a couple dashes of Cranberry Bitters, a crown of Ice, straw and Cracked Bay Leaves sticking out of the glass like rabbit ears.

	</table>
	<p> The term Tonic has been used to describe a quinine based sparkling water beverage accompanied by a clear spirit in highball form. You may be surprised to hear that the actual definition of a tonic is “a medicinal substance taken to give a feeling of vigor or well-being”. With that being said, we will have a rotating selection of seasonal tonics that provide more than just a refreshing experience. This season’s tonic is Cactus to aid in hydration. Aloe contains many other health benefits as well as its counterparts, Lemongrass and Jasmine. To make this drink, Shake as you would any other shaken drink and strain into a Nick & Nora Glass. Top with 1 oz of Soda and garnish with a quartered cube of Candied Prickly Pear on a pick laying across the glass.

Dirty dump the mix into the bottom of a Double Old Fashioned Glass. Top with hand cracked ice cubes.

	</table>
	<p> Only original in the addition of Horse Bitters (combination of Horseradish Vodka and Chamomile Tincture). This classic cocktail hails from the same pantheon of classics like the stone fence and hot toddy. Simple straightforward combination of apple juice and horseradish. We run the apple through a centrifugal juicer to give it a frothy whipped texture. Grab your glass and Block Ice, drop the bitters in the bottom. Quarter an apple, removing any stickers. Insert quarter by quarter, pressing down on the top of the pressure inducer. Juice will flow, the villagers rejoice. Garnish with fresh grated Horseradish using a microplane. Do not use the microplane for anything else.
