Info + Technique - A major issue with tall / long drinks is their predilection to separate flavors. This issue is compounded by the weight of the ingredients utilized in this drink. To avoid this we will roll the drink instead of building it in the glass so as to blend every flavor together. Add all ingredients to a tin filled halfway with cube ice. Roll into a Collins glass twice. Garnish with Lemon Peel and a straw. Top with additional Guinness for a frothy head.
