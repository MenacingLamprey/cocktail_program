This project has the purpose of receiving a cocktail menus "specs" for each drink, as well as weekly sales broken down by drink of a given buisness.  The program will use the specs to generate styled html documents which can be used as either a menu or to create a  list of instructions for drink creation. Additionally, the weekly sales will be used to predict the amount of product needed to be prepared.
